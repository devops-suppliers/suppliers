# suppliers
NYU DevOps Project - Supplier

Project Brief
The suppliers resource associates products with the vendor that supplies them to our business.
It should contain information about the supplier, and a collection of references to the products
that they provide. Its may also include the wholesale price of the products. Since this is really a
collection of product items, you will need to implement a subordinate API to associate products
into the suppliers collection (e.g., /suppliers/{id}/products).
