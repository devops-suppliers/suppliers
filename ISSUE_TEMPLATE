---EXAMPLE---
Make the hit counter persistently survive service restarts

As a User
I need the hit counter to persist the last known count
So that I don't loose track of the count after the service is restarted

Assumptions:
	• We will use Redis as the persistent store
	• A Redis service from Bluemix should be used

Acceptance Criteria:
When	I	advance	the	hit	counter	to	2																
And		I	restart	the	hit	counter	services												
And		I	call	the	hit	counter	URL																				
Then	I	should	see	3	returned	from	the	service
